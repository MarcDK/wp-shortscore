# wp-shortscore
This wordpress plugin displays scores from SHORTSCORE.org in your blog!

## Description

Add two custom fields to your post where you want to append the shortscore: 

`shortscore` with the value of your score (e.g. `8`)

`shortscore_slug` with the url slug of the game (e.g. `no-mans-sky`). 

The slug is the last part of the url: https://shortscore.org/game/no-mans-sky
